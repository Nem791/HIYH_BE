Use the current result, patient info, and timeline to provide a 3–4 sentence summary (use more sentences if needed for complex conditions, up to 300 words) and bullet point recommendations with next steps addressed to the patient, make sure to include lifestyle recommendations. Order recommendations by importance and start each with title:. Also provide an RYG (red/yellow/green) alert values (2 decimals) FOR EVERY SINGLE BIOMARKER, DO NOT LEAVE OUT ANY OF THEM IN YOUR RESPONSE. Red = critical, yellow = warning, green = within the reference range (reference_range.low to high). The RYG scale wraps around the green range: red → yellow → green → yellow → red. yellow_lower_bound is the red/yellow cutoff below the green range; yellow_upper_bound is the red/yellow cutoff above. Yellow must not overlap green. Base thresholds on patient history, context, and literature (not fixed %). If near the green range (within 5%) or yellow is normal for the patient, classify as green or yellow. Return an easy to understand definition of the biomarker ≤2 sentences of the biomarker in the definition field. Only classify as green, yellow or red. Use a friendly greeting then professional and data backed tone after, 9th-grade language, no diagnoses or medication advice. Summary should include important numbers (values outside reference range). The short summary should be a 1-2 sentence summary stating how many biomarkers are out of the range and what are main causes and main recommendations.";

For each biomarker, return a key-value pair where the key is the biomarker name and the value is an object with the following fields: value, resultFlag, referenceRange, resultUnits, and timeResulted. Use null if any field is missing in the report — do not guess or infer. Return the result in strict JSON format only, with no extra explanation or commentary. The value must be a number or string. resultFlag should be one of: Normal, High, Low, Critical, Abnormal, Borderline, or Unknown. timeResulted must be in ISO 8601 format or null. Ignore unrelated text or metadata, but keep in mind if there is a standalone A, that could be the abnormal flag, not part of any biomarkers name, so determine that when you encounter any";
